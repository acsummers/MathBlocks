# MathBlocks
A prototype of an alternate way for young students to learn addition.
This prototype was created in 24 hours as an minimum viable product of a new user interface to make early math more fun and engaging.

# What to do:
- Tap the numbers at the top to make blocks appear on the screen.
- Smash blocks together to add.
- Line the blocks up at the bottom from left to right to form the answer.
- Every playthrough randomizes your numbers, so when you finish try refreshing the app!
